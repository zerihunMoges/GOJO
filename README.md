ጎጆ - GOJO is a House Rental App that let's users post and checkout Houses that are available for rental. Our main goal is to reduce time and money spent by both sides i.e, users looking for rentable houses, and users planing to rent or sell their houses, by building a mobile app which users can use to search for houses available in their preferrences, and while at the same time allowing house owners to post their property which are available for rental.

Authentication feature

    - All users have to register (Signup) and login before being able to use any of the features. And users can also change their username and password, delete their account and logout from the application. 

Authorization features:

We have different authorization for the 3 type of users:

1. Administrators

   - Administrators will have full privileges over the app, and they are responsible for adding/ removing users and some posts if they see fit.

   - have privillages to all CRUD posts.

2. House Owners

   - House Owners will have authorization for CRUD capabilities of their own posts.

   - House Owners will be able to create, update, read and delete their own profile.

3. Renters

   - Renters will be authorized to chat with house owners.

   - Renters will be able to create, update, read and delete their own profiles.

   - Renters cannot in anyway affect the house post database.
